This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java, where two players use different Zoe avatars as their game pieces to distinguish between them. The game follows the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rules, with players taking turns to make their moves and aiming to achieve a line of three of their pieces on the game board to win.

## Game Rules

- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns to make their moves, with one using Player 1 - Zoe's avatar as their game piece and the other using Player 2 - Zoe's avatar.
- The objective is to place three of the same pieces in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.
- The game ends when one player wins or when all the cells are filled with no clear winner, resulting in a draw.
