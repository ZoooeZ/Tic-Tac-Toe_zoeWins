This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java, where two players use different Zoe avatars as their game pieces to distinguish between them. The game follows the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rules, with players taking turns to make their moves and aiming to achieve a line of three of their pieces on the game board to win.
